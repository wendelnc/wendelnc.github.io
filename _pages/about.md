I am a fifth-year graduate research assistant at Michigan State University specializing in high-order numerical methods for studying energy transfer in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. My work includes the development of SPARTHA, an arbitrarily high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) code for ideal MHD, built on the PARTHENON framework with KOKKOS for performance portability. My broader research interests span plasma physics, computational astrophysics, high-performance computing, and fluid dynamics. My code and related projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wendelnc).
